The application should be exported to windows.
To compile the source code use the "Export Application" and make sure FullScreen is
unchecked, Windows is checked and "Embed Java" is selected. Then click the "export"
button. 

To start the game, on a 64 bit operating system go to:
Compiled Game > application.windows64 > Mismatched.exe

On a 32 bit operating system:
Compiled Game > application.windows32 > Mismatched.exe


When opening the game and selecting to use GamePad, if no GamePad is plugged in
to computer press the "Exit Game" option and select to use the Keyboard and NumPad
instead.

If there is a GamePad plugged in and pressing 1 brings up the configure dialogue
box, configure your gamepad by selecting the device, clicking on the connection
for "move" and dragging it to "cooliehat" then clicking the connection for
"interact" and dragging it to "Button 0". Then, press save and "use configuration".

Once on the "Ready up" screen, both players should push any of their
movement controls and the game will begin.

Note: Using a Gamepad is not necessary as both players can use one keyboard, but it
will need to have a Numpad.
